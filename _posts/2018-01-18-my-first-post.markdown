Hello Earth Worl Wide Web People!

I am Scroopi Neupers, a Plutonian scientist. I am starting a blog to raise awareness for Pluto and the impending celestial 
disaster. Let this blog serve as an example of the path that the great World Wide Web People on Earth needs to avoid.

More details to come soon...I'm fairly certain all of my actions are being monitored.

Scroopi Neupers out.
